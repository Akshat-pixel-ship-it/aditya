      text: "Being in a shape is a necessity of healthy long innings of life. It adds charm to our personality as well as boosts our confidence. I am 45 years old male and with a job demanding continuous international travel. Irregular eating and sleeping habits was a part of life but ultimately it is the pandemic which brought a big plus to health. Being fit is always a dream for everyone but with lockdown restrictions work out in a gym was not an option. So along with WFH (Work From Home üè°), also started WOFH (Work Out From Home üè°). But for WOFH, there is a big effort to maintain discipline, regularity as well as the most important to do every WO (Work Out) correctly to have positive impact."

      text: "Champion at state as well as National level and of course body building to name a few of Adi's achievements in a short span. Easy going style along with focus on achieving objectives are his exceptional qualities which dramatically help students like me. Inspite of a large age difference, he is always like the best buddy, making me comfortable during work out but stretching my limits beyond what I can imagine. And the results clearly demonstrate how he has increased the bandwidth and mental strength of a person along with physical capabilities."

      text: "It always feels nice when people complement for the drastic changes from Bhopu tummy to a fitter personality. Importantly whenever I see in mirror there is a gentle smile on the face with a message striking the mind 'This credit goes to Adi'. Finally this is just a beginning of fit and healthy lifestyle for me, I have a dream. While I continue to take my fitness learnings from Adi and few years down the line when the world üåç successfully comes out of this pandemic, would like to participate in a body building competition like Mumbai Shree or similar where Adi is the chief guest of honor giving a special award in senior citizen category to one of his student and a strong follower üèÖü§ù. As he says 'Chal ready‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.'"

      text: "Knowing him for several years but taking online sessions and learning from him for the past 6 months, the weight has come down from 83 Kg to 74 Kg and feels like someone has taken away the garbage of 9 Kgs. It feels so nice, energetic and light on feet. Following a work out regime is one part and the intake of nutritional diet prescribed by Adi including intermittent fasting for a specific duration is the root cause for these positive results."
